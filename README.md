This repository contains a Perl code example demonstrating a potential issue with the `last` statement in loops. The primary problem lies in understanding how `last` affects loop termination and how it interacts with other Perl features. The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous behavior, while `bugSolution.pl` offers a corrected version.
